            <h2>The Pan Fried Taco</h2>
            </p>

            <p>This simple yet amazing dish will have your belly full and your ming content. For all those taco lovers out there, this recipe is a simple must-try!</p>

            <p>You can make crispy and savory pan-fried tacos with a quick, seasoned ground beef filling. Warming the corn tortillas beforehand prevents them from cracking as you fold them, and securing them with toothpicks keeps the filling inside during frying. </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h4>Filling</h4>

            <ul>

                <li>1 pound ground beef, at least 85/15</li>

                <li>1/2 cup finely chopped white onion</li>

                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                <li>1 packet taco seasoning, or homemade mix (see instructions below)</li>

                <li>1/2 cup water </li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Assembly and Friying</h4>

            <ul>

                <li>10 to 12 corn tortillas</li>

                <li>1 to 2 cups shredded cheese, like cheddar, Mexican blend, or Monterey Jack</li>

                <li>About 1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus more as needed </li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Homemade Seasoning (Optional)</h4>

            <ul>

                <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>

                <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef with the chopped onion, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Drain the excess grease. Add the minced garlic and cook for one more minute until fragrant. Stir in the taco seasoning and water, bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 to 8 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>

                <li><strong>Warm the tortillas:</strong>To make the tortillas pliable and prevent them from breaking, wrap a stack of 3 to 4 in a damp paper towel and microwave for about 30 seconds.</li>

                <li><strong>Assemble the tacos:</strong>Lay the warmed tortillas on a flat surface. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the beef mixture onto one half of each tortilla, and top with a small sprinkle of shredded cheese.</li>

                <li><strong>Heat the oil:</strong>Heat about 1/2 inch of oil in a clean skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. The oil is ready when a small piece of tortilla immediately sizzles.</li>

                <li><strong>Fry the tacos:</strong>Carefully place 2 to 3 tacos into the hot oil at a time. Use tongs to hold them folded for the first 30 seconds to help them hold their shape. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until the tortillas are golden brown and crispy.</li>

                <li><strong>Drain and serve:</strong>Use tongs to remove the tacos from the oil, tilting them to drain any excess oil back into the pan. Place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain, and serve hot with your favorite toppings, such as shredded lettuce, salsa, and sour cream. </li>
